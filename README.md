# Introduction

The goal is to find out if a car model is worthy of a recall. It is a binary classification problem with "recall" referred to as class 1 and "do not recall" as class 0. Experimentation with KNN and Decision Tree (DT) shows that KNN has better
performance as compared to DT and that the released model is recommended as recall.
